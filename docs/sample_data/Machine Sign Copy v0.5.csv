Ballyhoo,4817,January,1932,Bally Manufacturing Co.,"310 W Erie St, Chicago",Design by,Raymond T Maloney,,,,,"~50,000",The Flip Collection,,"Coin-operated pin bagatelle machines were made at a breakneck pace. At the height of the Great Depression these games were produced cheaply and quickly, offering new distractions, and ideas had to come just as fast. It was easiest to simply copy them.

Raymond Moloney wanted to make his own pin bagatelle machine, having issues sourcing and distributing Gottlieb's best-selling Baffle Ball (Gottlieb, Nov. 1931). Rather than develop it from scratch, he looked to the popular magazine Ballyhoo—the MAD magazine of the 1930s—and simply used their colors and style. He even kept the title the same and called his company Bally, though this machine is labelled with Bally's parent company, Lion Manufacturing.",706,110,
Carom,458,January,1937,Bally Manufacturing Co.,"310 W Erie St, Chicago",,,,,,,,From the collection of Gene Cunningham,,"After Bally's success with Ballyhoo, their business exploded. Between Ballyhoo and Carom, they made more than 120 different models. As you can see, in just five years they became larger, more complex, and more automated. The window on the backbox shows the score, an exciting innovation called a totalizer.

This is an example of a payout machine, where you might get more money out than you put in. This feature arguably made it a gambling machine, causing concern about how pinball was corrupting the youth, encouraging vice, and supporting criminals. However you see it, it was big business: 45 of those 120 models made by Bally gave payouts.",645,107,
Baseball,189,October,1947,Chicago Coin Machine Manufacturing Co.,"1725 W Diversey Blvd, Chicago",,,,,,,,The Flip Collection,,"Chicago Coin, like other major manufacturers, stopped producing machines in 1942 to support the US's effort in World War II. Production resumed in 1945, making machines similar to those in the early 1940s. The central figure on the backglass likely references the then-popular All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which started 1943, and whose story was told in A League of Their Own.

One month after this machine left the factory, Gottileb release the first machine with flippers, Humpty Dumpty. This machine's flippers were added later, likely by an operator updating his older machines to match the new craze.",625,97,
Derby Day,664,April,1956,D. Gottlieb & Co.,"1140–50 N Kostner Ave, Chicago",Design by,Wayne Neyens,Art by,Roy Parker,,,"1,600",From the collection of Sam Harvey,gobble_hole.svg,"Derby Day's gambling theme extends to its gameplay—there is far less control than in more modern pinball machines. The flippers are spaced far apart, the player is at the mercy of a pop bumper beneath them, and a ""gobble hole"" in the middle of the board will quickly end a ball, though it rewards some points in the process as compensation.

The gobble hole in this machine echoes the ""Bally Hole"" in Ballyhoo, which doubles a player's entire score. However, as flippers and their placement made pinball games longer, a bundle of points began to pale in comparison to keeping the ball in play. Gobble holes became extremely rare after the early 1960s.",651,112,

Teacher's Pet,2506,December,1965,"Williams Electronic Games, Inc.","3401 N California Ave, Chicago",Concept and design by,Steve Kordek,,,,,"1,600",From the collection of Sam Harvey,,"As players gained more control over pinball machines, games grew longer. The modern flipper placement of Teacher's Pet lets players keep the ball in play, and the addition of free games granted by high scores—invented by Bill Belah in 1934—made the idea of indefinitely long play even more tangible. Teacher's Pet features a free ball gate on its right-hand outlane that saves the ball when activated.

Adding free plays was also a way of showing that pinball was not for gambling. Some manufacturers embraced this, while others doubled down on payouts—until pinball was banned in Chicago. Although this machine was made here, it could not be played in the city.",662,109,
Hokus Pokus,1206,April,1975,Bally Manufacturing Co.,"2640 W Belmont Ave, Chicago",Design by,Greg Kmiec,Art by,Christian Marche,,,"3,086",The Flip Collection,,"While pin bagatelle machines operate in one direction—down—and flippers keep the ball in play, playfields had to change for a player to do more than just keep the ball alive. Compared to Teacher's Pet, the lanes in Hokus Pokus are easier to target from each flipper. On the left-hand side, this allows the ball to travel all the way to the start of the playfield, where bumpers and targets can rack up the points.

These points are also part of how pinball has developed. As time goes on, machines have offered higher and higher scores. The last score wheel in Hokus Pokus is actually fake, automatically multiplying any score by ten.",634,110,
The Incredible Hulk,1266,October,1979,D. Gottlieb & Co.,"165 W Lake St, Northlake, IL",Design by,Ed Krynski,Art by,Gordon Morison,,,"6,150",The Flip Collection,,"In the late 1970s, pinball jumped to the digital age: older electromechanical machines were replaced by new ""solid state"" games, typified by their use of transistors. Going digital opened new possibilities for pinball. In The Incredible Hulk, sounds are not limited to physical objects inside the machine and include a broad range of effects. Lights, too, got flashier. In some machines, bonuses could also now be carried from one ball to the next, even with multiple rotating players.

Players' ability to pick up where they left off also enriched these games' narratives. The Incredible Hulk arranges its bonuses in a ladder, giving a linear progression to its gameplay. Later machines would turn this progression into full-blown quests and missions.",752,118,

Blackout,317,June,1980,"Williams Electronics, Inc","3401 N. California Ave, Chicago",Design by,Claude Fernandez,Art by,"Constantino Mitchell, Jeanine Mitchell",Sound by,Paul Dussault,"7,050",The Flip Collection,,"As Chicago has been the gravitation center of pinball design and manufacturing for decades, so too have Chicago-based artists been integral to pinball art. For Blackout, Williams reached out to the painter Ed Paschke (1939–2004), who was an important member of the Chicago Imagists, a group redefining contemporary art in their own surreal style. Many Imagists were themselves influenced by pinball—as demonstrated by a 2017 exhibition at the Elmhurst Art Museum—and Paschke himself owned a Gorgar machine (Williams, 1979).

Unfortunately for Paschke, his avant-garde style was not what Williams wanted. After producing his concept painting for this machine, also titled Blackout (1980), the company thought it was too ""far out."" Its amorphous, masked astronauts, its multicolored cosmic rays, and its pock-marked green planet were too strange. The company tapped Constantino Mitchell—himself a student of Ray Yoshida, another Chicago Imagist—to redesign Paschke's painting in a more conventional style. But, according to Mitchell, ""I want Ed Paschke to get credit for [the] Blackout backglass design. He did the original art concept. Ed Paschke was my teacher and mentor at the Art Institute of Chicago. His usage of color influenced me for the rest of my life.""

Paschke went on to curate an exhibition of pinball art in 1982 at the Chicago Cultural Center with Mitchell's collaboration.

Hyperball,3169,December,1981,"Willams Electronics, Inc","3401 N California Ave, Chicago IL 60618",Design by,Steve Ritchie,Art by,Seamus McLaughlin,Sound by:,Tim Murphy,"5,000",The Flip Collection,,"During this time, the pinball industry was under threat from video games like Space Invaders (1978), Asteroids (1979), Battlezone (1980) and Pac Man (1980). They responded by trying to innovate. Williams hoped that Hyperball would sell 50,000 units. But operators complained about the difficulty maintaining it and players found it confusing, so it flopped, selling only 5,000.

Although made by a major pinball company and created by a famous pinball designer, many pinball fans insist that Hyperball is not a pinball machine. They have a point; lacking flippers, bumpers, or targets, Hyperball is more akin to mechanical shooting games popular early in the 20th century.

To play it, think of it like a video game. The lightning bolts are trying to destroy your base. Shoot them before they get you!

Eight Ball Deluxe Limited Edition,763,August,1982,Bally Manufacturing Co.,"2640 W Belmont Ave, Chicago IL 60618",Design by,George Christian,Art by,Margaret Hudson,,,"2,388",The Flip Collection,,"A successor to the popular Eight Ball from 1977, Eight Ball Deluxe added more rules, more complicated shots, and speech synthesis. It was another hit, winning the Amusement Machine Operators Association award for Game of the Year in 1983.

The first version of this game, Eight Ball Deluxe, launched in April 1981, quickly sold 8,250 machines. This version, Eight Ball Deluxe Limited Edition, sold 2,388 units. It plays the same but has an unusual backbox, reusing the leftovers from Bally's answer to Hyperball, Rapid Fire (1982). Demand continued, so Bally Midway released a third version of it, also called Eight Ball Deluxe, in 1984.",637,103,
The Getaway: High Speed II,1000,February,1992,"Williams Electronic Games, Inc.","3401 N California Ave, Chicago IL 60618",Design by,Steve Ritchie,Art by,"Doug Watson, Mark Sprenger",Sound by,Dan Forden,"13,259",The Flip Collection,,"Created by prolific pinball designer Steve Ritchie, who also designed Hyperball, this is the sequel to his 1986 hit High Speed. Making use of the then-new dot matrix display (DMD), it did away with the permanent score displays prominent since the 1940s. Instead, a grid of LEDs was used to show not just scores but information and basic animations.

This era of machine also adds music and extensive sampled sound, creating a richer experience and helping them compete with video games. As compared with Eight Ball Deluxe, this also uses a third dimension with ramps and wireforms (aka habitrails). Earlier generation of pinball machines tended to reuse the same components with just visual changes, but from the DMD era forward, toys and features made for just one machine become common.",788,129,
The Addams Family,20,March,1992,Midway Manufacturing Co.,"3401 N California Ave, Chicago IL 60618",Design by,Pat Lawlor,Art by,John Youssi,Sound by,Chris Granner,"20,270",On loan from William Pietri,,"The Addams Family, the best-selling flipper pinball machine of all time, is widely loved. It was based on the 1991 comedy/horror movie The Addams Family, which was based on the 1964 television series and New Yorker cartoons from Charles Addams that ran from 1933 to 1964.

It uses both samples from the movie and custom audio recorded by Raul Julia. It was also the first pinball machine to make use of ""artificial intelligence""; a simulated neural network drives the ""Thing Flips"" feature, where it automatically shoots the ball from the small upper left flipper to The Swamp on the right. And keep an eye out for the disembodied hand, Thing, which may take your ball.",669,114,
Godzilla (Premium),6841,October,2021,"Stern Pinball, Inc","2001 Lunt Avenue, Elk Grove Village",Design by,Keith Elwin,Art by,Jeremy Packer,,,,The Flip Collection,,"One of the best selling games in recent decades, Stern's Godzilla is a great example of a modern pinball machine. Instead of the earlier dot-matrix display, it uses full-motion video on an LCD screen. It has rich sound, a very colorful playfield, and makes extensive use of single-color and RGB LEDs to create a compelling light show.

Also common is that Godzilla is based on licensed material. This provides an instant audience for the machine. Here, Stern made extensive use of the Shōwa era Godzilla films (1954-1975) to provide both a structure for the game and video clips to keep players engaged and bystanders entertained.
