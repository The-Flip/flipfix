      "description": "- On a 1-player game, it gives you 10 balls. And it won't start a two-player game unless you hold down the relay for longer than it would normally close. - The issue seems to be related to the second switch from the top on a relay with name something like \"2nd player select\", but that name doesn't appear on the circuit diagram. I tried cleaning it, without luck, and I also adjusted it to be tighter. But it'll work if I hold it closed while it's cycling.  - I suspect something weird in the backbox, where the second-player state is represented. But I need a second person to fix it.",

The first 5 output pins on AF are steady low, but they're steady high on Getaway. The last one on AF switches from steady high to steady low when the flippers are enabled. My general take being that high means inhibit, and low means active.\n\nAs before, the OC pin is low for AF. For Getaway, it's high at U1 pin 1, but low at the connector (J113, p31). It's also high further back on the CPU board. Our initial theory was that maybe U1 itself was bad, but swapping for a new chip didn't help. However, grounding U1 pin 1 to pull it low does make the lights work. The problem is certainly on this board, so I'm sending it in for repair.",
